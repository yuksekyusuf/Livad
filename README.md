# Livad
Livad is a startup specializing in creating monetization tools for live streaming on Twitch. During my tenure as an iOS developer, I:
- Designed the architectural framework.
- Developed the initial phases of the iOS application for the streamers' platform.
- The company's strategic decision to discontinue development on the mobile client
## Tech/Frameworks Used
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Protocol-Oriented Programming
- Auth0

I employed a pragmatic approach in my architectural design, combining MVVM and VIPER, inspired by [this article](https://omerfarukgul.medium.com/a-pragmatic-approach-to-mobile-architecture-f5e12175aacf).
